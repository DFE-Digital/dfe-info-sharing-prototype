# Growing Up Well Information Sharing prototypes

This prototype contains two quite separate concepts that have been explored during the alpha phase. 

These two streams of work are mentioned throughout as `referal` and `directory`, these are described in greater detail below.

In general, the prototype follows standard 'prototype kit' conventions and comprehensive [documentation and examples](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs) are available in the usual places.

## Directory 

The directory elements of the prototype relate to a body of work that have explored the concept of allowing users to search or otherwise arrive at a record containing details of a child or professional. In the simplest of terms, the `directory` stream of work is considering how multiple sources of information can be aggregated in a common interface (consolidated record) to support better communication between professionals with a view to improve support for children.

There are a number of complex factors involved and there is more to be understood about the type of data available at the time of writing. 

The approach taking within the prototype has been to decouple the data held and the views that play this back to users so that the two concerns can be addressed independently. It is fair to say that the type of data that might be available is a 'known unknown' in that we are aware there is more to be learnt in this area.
