                Original thinking included botha child record as well as a professional record, during
                Sprint 1 it was established through workshops and conversations with stakeholders that the
                user only needed a child level record but with contacts details on professionals displayed
                within the timeline. This approach drove the content that was to be displayed within the
                timeline.

                While working on the Child record search screen it was decided to make this as open as
                possible at this stage. This will form part of the usability testing user research, where we
                will discover how users want to find the relevant records.
            <p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Filters on the timeline were addressed, initial ideas are to include basic high level
                filters and then to further pursue this during UR usability testing.
            <p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                It was established that the data being fed into the service may change between local
                authorities, especially when looking at the timeline and the taxonomy used by each Family
                Hub/LA etc. With this in mind consideration needs to be made when designing how the timeline
                displays data, we need to ensure that we are allowing for varying levels of data whilst
                maintaining an eye on the data being useful and actionable by the user groups.

                The term 'family' has been deemed out of scope as it is currently difficult too define the
                makeup of a family. Instead, we are focussing efforts around the child's record and their
                touchpoints with professionals.

                While the project aim is for a nationwide service, cross LA address tracking is considered a
