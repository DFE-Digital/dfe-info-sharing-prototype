             <p class="govuk-body">
               Biggest 'learn' came from a Co-design session around 'Risks and Warnings'. Original thinking for this section of the design was around the ability to forewarn key users of situations where more care may need to be taken, however, it was discovered during the co
             <p>
               <p class="govuk-body">
                 Conclusion was to remove the 'risks and warnings' reference from the service, a side but key outcome of the conversation was to ensure that the service must remain 'Agnostic' so as to remove any bias to the key user group about any situation around a child.

              What we learnt during this sprint 
            </h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
              Original thinking included botha child record as well as a professional record, during Sprint 1 it was established through workshops and conversations with stakeholders that the user only needed a child level record but with contacts details on professionals displayed within the timeline. This approach drove the content that was to be displayed within the timeline.
            <p>
              <p class="govuk-body">
               While working on the Child record search screen it was decided to make this as open as possible at this stage. This will form part of the usability testing user research, where we will discover how users want to find the relevant records.
              <p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                  Filters on the timeline were addressed, initial ideas are to include basic high level filters and then to further pursue this during UR usability testing.
                <p>
             <p class="govuk-body">
               It was established that the data being fed into the service may change between local authorities, especially when looking at the timeline and the taxonomy used by each Family Hub/LA etc. With this in mind consideration needs to be made when designing how the timeline displays data, we need to ensure that we are allowing for varying levels of data whilst maintaining an eye on the data being useful and actionable by the user groups.
