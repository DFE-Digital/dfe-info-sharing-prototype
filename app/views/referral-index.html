          The referral process is to allow professionals and front-line workers to refer a person or family in need for targeted services (social services). This service aims to help the workers in the community hubs by elevating the pain points within the referral process.

                The protoype works fairly well for the users.
              </li>
              <li>
                Users may not be submitting concerns about more than one person or more than one type of concern, leading to the dual taks-list format being redundant. We need to prompt this further with more complex scenarios.
              </li>
              <li>
                High level concern categories need some more work and we need to test out that these make sense to the users. We also need to find out if they are required at all. Read the next point.
              </li>
              <li>
                We need to find out if the questions change based on what the scenario is, or if a generic set of questions are appropraite, this may lead us to not need to collect the high-level concern area.
              </li>
              <li>
                We have found that some things in the form may be optional, not needed, not known, or not required at the point of discussion as they could be found out later. We need to work on these areas to ensure best usability and speedyness of filling out the form.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is possible we could design the layout differently to avoid the dual task lists. Dual task lists breaks away from standard patterns but the solution to avoid a dual task-list would also break away from standard patterns

              The prototype experimented with a guidance based approach for some of the questions, although these need to be tested out to prove or disprove that they work better for the users of the service the gut feeling is that the guidance reduces the ambiguity around what is required to be filled for the relative sections.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
              I would suggest that the team speaks to service experts in LA Front Door teams to find out exactly what is expected to be filled in as a minimum or for 'what good looks like' to determine guidance text.

                As a interaction designer for the referral service on the Info Sharing Alpha during <strong>sprint 2</strong> I have been blocked in many directions from project requirements and understanding.
              </p>
              <p class="govuk-body">
                Requirements are still not fully understood and the team are going back to the drawing board in terms of ideation in the coming sprint. Part way through the sprint the requirements changed and this is reflected in the Sprint Goals above.
              </p>
              <p class="govuk-body">
                There has been two versions of the prototype created during this sprint which have taken inspiration from exisiting PDF forms. The second - <a href="v3/referral" class="govuk-link" target="_blank">Version 3 - Sprint 2 prototype</a> - was able to start looking at better usability for filling in the form in more complex scenarios with multiple people involved in the case.
